            <h5>‘Education is not a preparation for life, education is life itself.’</h5>
            <br>
            Inspired from this, our motto `Excellence in Education’ is a resounding echo to this very purpose and to which every Hayagriva(n) is deeply devoted. During this academic year, we have witnessed numerous unprecedented challenges which has redefined our limits in all spheres of teaching and learning experience, be it curricula, assessment, new teaching staff or importantly, students too.
            
            
            
            Real-life application of knowledge and skills has been the hallmark of the education revolution at Hayagriva Schools. The caring and sensitized ethos at Hayagriva has helped our students evolve into caring and achieving members of society and blossom into responsible, global citizens. In the year that was, we have seen ample evidence of digital learning, adapting to the new normal and cross-cultural exposure in classrooms and outside. We provide the platform and work smart applaud our students in all their activities, be with them, behind them and around them. Hayagriva Schools rejoices & celebrates the success of its students. Through this we have created a niche for ourselves in the field of modern education.
            
            I take this opportunity to thank all parents who have reposed their faith in our school. As always, we assure to provide your child the best learning experience. Hayagriva staff incessantly innovate means and methods to provide the highest quality of academic excellence to your child. Our school has built a cohesive ambience thriving in warmth and care to make learning all the more enjoyable for your child.     
            
            I would like to end with the words of Albert Einstein:
            
            “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For while knowledge defines all we currently know and understand, imagination points to all we might yet discover and create.”

                        Hailing from a family that pursues education as a passion, it was but natural for Mr. Kiran Vijaya to be inspired by changing the face of education. Post his educational grooming in the UK, where he imbibed the rudiments of management, Mr. Kiran was driven with a passion to go beyond academics for the all round development of the students in the institutions, that is a part of the Vijay Kiran Group of Companies.
  
                        He rhapsodically focused on setting up facilities of global standards that paved the way for talent to be refined. His prime areas of focus and development have been Extra- Curricular activities, innovative ways of learning and building up of one’s personality. Mindfulness is a core competency of Mr. Kiran Vijaya hence VK Sports – an entity that caters to sports training, leisure activities, personal grooming, health benefits, eating healthy and staying fit emerged under his guidance<br>

          <p>Recently, National Grid launched a surprise dance performance in a Saugus, MA mall as part of its 'Tap into Savings' campaign. In many ways, this performance resembled a flash mob, with dancers appearing seemingly from nowhere, to engage an unsuspecting crowd of shoppers, and then disperse.

            As a social phenomenon, the flash mob emerged in the early 00's, enabled by Internet and mobile connectivity. While some flash mobs organize spontaneously, most are actually well-choreographed events that often captivate unsuspecting audiences where they occur. One of the most viewed flash mobs was a choreographed rendition of "Do Re Mi" from The Sound of Music in Central Station Antwerp, Belgium.</p>
